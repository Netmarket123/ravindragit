# shoutem-client
Shoutem React Native App

## Testing
Mocha (test framework), Chai (assertion lib) and Enzyme (utility for react) are used for unit testing.

### Writing a test
- Every test should end with *.spec.js*
- Test file should be named **exactly **as tested file
- Optionally it can be placed in \_tests\_ folder at same level as is tested file

### Running a test
- To run test just run `npm test` from extension root.
- If you receive error "Slash module missing" when running npm test, re-run npm install (sometimes slash doesn't get installed)

Todo - note which shoutem cli command is used to setup test environment
