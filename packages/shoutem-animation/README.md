## Examples


## Shoutem

This package was developed by [Shoutem](http://shoutem.github.io), platform for supercharging React Native development. We enable creating RN applications through plug-in like architecture. These plug-ins, called [extensions](http://shoutem.github.io/), encapsulate common app functionalities (like Push Notifications, Authentication with your favorite services, User On-boarding, etc.) which makes development of the application extremely fast by reusing already built extensions. Sign up for beta on our [developer portal](http://shoutem.github.io).
