# UI Toolkit
UI Toolkit is a set of styleable components that enables you to build beautiful React Native applications for iOS and Android. All our components are built to be both composable and [themeable](http://github.com/shoutem/theme). Each component has a predefined style that is compatible with the rest of the toolkit, which makes it possible to build complex components that look great without the need to manually define complex styles.
## Install
```
$ npm install @shoutem/ui
$ rnpm link
```
## Docs
All the documentation is available on the [Developer portal](http://shoutem.github.io/docs/ui-toolkit/introduction).
## Shoutem
This package was developed by [Shoutem](http://shoutem.github.io), platform for supercharging React Native development. We enable creating RN applications through plug-in like architecture. These plug-ins, called [extensions](http://shoutem.github.io/), encapsulate common app functionalities (like Push Notifications, Authentication with your favorite services, User on-boarding, etc.) which makes development of mobile applications extremely fast by reusing already built extensions. Sign up for beta on our [developer portal](http://shoutem.github.io).
